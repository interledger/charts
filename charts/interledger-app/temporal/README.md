# Temporal

*NOTE: This chart has been abandoned and will be deleted in the future*

Originally we started creating our own chart because the containers we wanted to use was very old. In the end this was too time consuming so we decided to go for a newer version of temporal. This chart is now abandoned and will be deleted in the future.

The current status is that the temporal server seems to be running fine, but I could not get the web UI to work. The errors are unclear and I have not had the time to investigate further.
